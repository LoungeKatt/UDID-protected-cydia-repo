UDID-protected-cydia-repo
============

A sample UDID-protected Cydia repository.

To use it, edit the accepted UDIDs inside checker.php

See .htaccess which plays an important role here.

If you are using lighttpd, include lighttpd_mod_rewrite.conf in your lighttpd server configuration, or paste its contents in.
